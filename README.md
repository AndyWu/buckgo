This is for people to see how much $$ they make from Coinbase's services. Do not use it to file tax returns. There could be errors.

I wrote a program to calculate my tax 3 years ago, about a week before Coinbase released my tax report. At least the outcome of my program was consistent with Coinbase's. Coinbase doesn't provide that information in 2021 and wants people to pay for it.

It was a ~100 line nodejs program that took me 3 evenings to code it. I rewrite the program so it's accessible through web browsers. This code is not tested. It doesn't handle all cases. It parses my CSV file exported from Coinbase. But it might not work on others'.

This is my first Gatsby app. The project name was generated by https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/.
